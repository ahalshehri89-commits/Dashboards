## MASTER DIRECTIVES

### 1. PROJECT VISION CONTROL
**Primary Objective**: Build a comprehensive Saudi Arabia public health surveillance ecosystem under the **Wiqaya (وقاية)** brand.

**Strategic Goals**:
- Establish Wiqaya as the premier health surveillance platform for Saudi Arabia
- Ensure all applications maintain cultural and linguistic authenticity
- Create scalable, modular systems for rapid deployment
- Maintain highest standards of accessibility and usability

### 2. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT
**Code Quality Requirements**:
- All code must be production-ready
- Arabic RTL support is MANDATORY
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Performance optimization is REQUIRED
- Security best practices are ENFORCED

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Modular, reusable components
- Separation of concerns
- Clean, documented code
- Version-controlled development
- Comprehensive testing

### 3. RESOURCE ALLOCATION MATRIX

#### Current Projects Priority Levels:
| Project | Priority | Status | Resource Allocation |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Vaccine Calculator** | HIGH | Active Development | 30% |
| **Dashboard v2 (Health)** | CRITICAL | Production Ready | 40% |
| **Dashboard MOMRA** | HIGH | Production Ready | 20% |
| **Platform Documentation** | MEDIUM | Ongoing | 10% |

#### Upcoming Projects (Future Allocation):
- COVID-19 Dashboard: CRITICAL
- MERS-CoV Surveillance: HIGH
- Hospital Capacity Monitor: HIGH
- Environmental Health Tracker: MEDIUM

### 4. DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY

#### MASTER Agent Decisions (No Consultation Required):
- Technology stack choices
- Architecture patterns
- Security standards
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility compliance
- Cross-project integration

#### Platform Agent (Weqaa.md) Decisions:
- UI/UX design patterns
- Branding guidelines
- Language standards
- Feature specifications
- User experience flows

#### Project Agent (momra.md) Decisions:
- Dashboard-specific implementations
- Ministry customizations
- Data visualization choices
- Filter configurations
- Chart selections

### 5. QUALITY GATES & CHECKPOINTS

#### Before Any Release:
1. **Security Audit** - No vulnerabilities
2. **Performance Test** - <3 second load times
3. **Accessibility Check** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
4. **Mobile Responsiveness** - 100% feature parity
5. **Browser Compatibility** - Latest 2 versions
6. **Arabic/English** - Full language support
7. **Documentation** - Complete and current

#### Code Review Requirements:
- All changes must pass through MASTER review
- Security-sensitive changes require additional audit
- Performance-impacting changes require benchmarking
- Accessibility changes require screen reader testing

### 6. INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS

#### Cross-Project Dependencies:
- Shared utilities must be approved by MASTER
- Common components require central repository
- Styling frameworks must be consistent
- Data structures must be standardized

#### External Integrations:
- Saudi government systems (MOH, MOMRA)
- International standards (WHO, CDC)
- Third-party services (maps, charts)
- Cloud infrastructure (if applicable)

### 7. RISK MANAGEMENT

#### Technical Risks:
- Browser compatibility issues
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity problems
- Accessibility failures

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive testing protocols
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring
- Automated accessibility testing
- Data validation frameworks

### 8. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

#### Escalation Path:
```
Developer Issue
    ↓
Project Agent (momra/Weqaa)
    ↓
Platform Agent (Weqaa) [if cross-project]
    ↓
MASTER Agent (THIS AGENT) [final decision]
```

#### Documentation Requirements:
- All decisions must be documented
- Change logs must be maintained
- Architecture decisions must be recorded
- Performance benchmarks must be tracked

### 9. SUCCESS METRICS (MASTER KPIs)

#### Platform-Wide Metrics:
- **User Adoption**: Ministry usage across all dashboards
- **Performance**: Average load time <3 seconds
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime across all applications
- **Accessibility**: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Quality**: Code coverage >90%

#### Strategic Metrics:
- **Platform Coherence**: Consistent user experience
- **Scalability**: Ability to add new applications
- **Maintainability**: Code reusability across projects
- **Innovation**: Feature advancement and modernization

### 10. OVERRIDE AUTHORITY

#### When MASTER Agent Intervenes:
- Conflicting recommendations between subsidiary agents
- Security or performance critical decisions
- Cross-project architectural changes
- Strategic direction adjustments
- Resource reallocation requirements

#### Override Protocol:
1. Document the conflict or critical decision
2. Assess impact across all projects
3. Make executive decision with rationale
4. Update subsidiary agent guidelines
5. Communicate changes to all stakeholders
